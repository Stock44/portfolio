Hey there!
My name is Hiram Muñoz, and I'm a software engineer from Monterrey, Mexico. I earned my degree from the [Monterrey Institute of
Technology (Tecnológico de Monterrey)](https://tec.mx/en).
I love all things related to science, technology, design,
and innovation, and I always want to keep learning.

I am most proficient in full-stack web development, but I really consider myself as more of a generalist.
If there is an opportunity for me to try something new, I will take it. As of right now, I have worked on projects
involving web design, machine learning, data analysis, video processing, among others.

This page is my attempt at sharing some of the things I have learned.
I hope that the content I publish here will be of use to somebody during their work.
