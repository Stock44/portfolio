Hi!
My name is Hiram Muñoz, and I'm a software engineer from Monterrey, Mexico. I earned my degree from the [Monterrey Institute of
Technology (Tecnológico de Monterrey)](https://tec.mx/en).
I love all things related to science, technology, design,
and innovation, and I always want to keep learning.

I am most proficient in full-stack web development, but I really consider myself as more of a generalist.
If there is an opportunity for me to try something new, I will take it. As of right now, I have worked on projects
involving web design, machine learning, data analysis, video processing, among others.

In the front-end, I specialize in working with [React](https://react.dev),
although I have dabbled in other frameworks at times.
One such example is this site, which is mostly framework-less except for the more interactive sections;
these are done with [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev).
Further details into the implementation of this site are
available [here](/posts/1-about-this-page).
I am also a firm proponent of [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for
styling websites.

Regarding the back-end, my current technology of choice is the [.NET platform](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/).
I specifically specialize in working with the [F# programming language](https://fsharp.org) and GraphQL. I have also
used JavaScript frameworks such as [NextJS](https://nextjs.org), as well as server frameworks for other languages such
as Go and Python.

I have worked on projects involving data analysis and machine learning, during which I mainly used the Python
programming language, along with libraries such as [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org)
, [scikit-learn](https://pandas.pydata.org), and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io).

This page is my attempt at sharing some of the things I have learned.
I hope that the content I publish here will be of use to somebody during their work.
